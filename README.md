# Gatsby Theme Simple bio

This repo is an example and potential starting point for theme creators.

It includes:
- a bare-bones theme (located in `gatsby-theme-simple-bio/`) that includes basic setup
- a demo site (located in `demo/`) that installs the theme
- a Yarn workspaces configuration so the theme and demo can be worked on simultaneously
